	<p> The Virtual Environment was created by an interdisciplinary team of engineers at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The project was proposed by group member Eleanor Wolfe. Eleanor experiences Autism throughout her daily life. She has a passion for education and through that passion teamed up with Kassedy Whitener and Daniel James to create this project which allows those not on the Autism spectrum to experience the hyper-sensitivites that those on the spectrum face. Please take time to read more about the creators below, see the hisory tab and before entering the environment view the saftey warning. </p>
