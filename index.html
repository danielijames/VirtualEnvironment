	<p> The Virtual Environment was created by an interdisciplinary team of engineers at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. This project was proposed by student Eleanor Wolfe. She intimately understands the complications associated with being on the Autism spectrum. Her passion for education inspired her to propose a project whereby those who are not on the Autism spectrum could experience sensory overload similar to what a person with Autism may feel. Her project proposal was accepted by instructors at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga and a team consisting of Kassedy Whitener and Daniel James was formed to make this project a reality. Once you enter the virtual environment you will be prompted with interactive videos which strive to educate users by example. Please take time to read more about the creators below, see the hisory tab and before entering the environment view the saftey warning. </p>
